          <h1>History</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Now the history of Rome is pretty extensive, to say the least. But to
        sum it up, Rome has three periods: the <b>Period of Kings</b>, <b>Republican Rome</b>,
        and <b>Imperial Rome</b>.</p>
        <div class="page-header align-left">
          <h1>Period of Kings (625-510 BC)</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Legend has it that Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus, twin sons of
        the god of war, Mars. After killing his brother, Romulus took the title as
        the first king of Rome, thereby starting the Roman Period of Kings. This
        period had only six kings after Romulus, under which Rome saw many militaristic and economic
        advances. It was in this period that the Roman constitution was formed,
        paving the way for the Republican period of Rome.</p>

        <div class="page-header align-left">
          <h1>Republican Rome (510-31 BC)</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Rome is no longer under the rule of a king, and developed a new form of
        government: a Republic. Governemnt matters were now settled by the upper
        class, primarily senators. Yet the Romans would elect a dictator in times
        of crisis. Rome took control of the entire Italian peninsula in this period
        and became the dominant Mediterranean power. Civil war followed soon after
        leaving in a state of unrest the led to the rise of dictator Julius Caesar.
        Under Caesar Rome became increasingly imperialistic, extending its borders
        beyond the Mediterranean. Caesar's assassination in 44 BC led to the rise
        of Octavian as the first emperor of Rome.</p>
        <div class="page-header align-left">
          <h1>Imperial Rome (31 BC - AD 476)</h1>
        </div>
        <p>This final period of Rome lasted from the rise of its first emperor to
        the Rome's fall. Rome was in a good period of its life during this time.
        The empire had reached its maximum size, spanning across three continents
        including Asia Minor, Northern Africa, and most of Europe. The empire had
        grown so large that in AD 286 it split itself into two united empires, each
        with its own emperor. Unfortunately, the western empire fell in AD 455 upon
        suffering Gothic invasions. This is largely considered the end of the overall
        Roman empire, however the eastern Roman empire (aka the Byzantine Empire)
        survived until the 15th century, when Turks took control of the capital city, Constantinople
        (modern-day Istanbul).</p>
