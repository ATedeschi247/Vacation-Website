        really want to go there, but I don't have a clue of what I should do!"<br>
        If the answer is yes, then you have come to the right place! Our staff of

        the Vatican, and immerse yourself in all of the sights and sounds in between.<br>
        Are you ready?</p>

      <div id="history">
        <div class="page-header text-center">
          <h1>History</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Now the history of Rome is... extensive, to say the least. But to
        sum it up, Rome has three periods: the <b>Period of Kings</b>, <b>Republican Rome</b>,
        and <b>Imperial Rome</b>.</p>
        <div class="page-header align-left">
          <h1>Period of Kings (625-510 BC)</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Legend has it that Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus, twin sons of
        the god of war, Mars. After killing his brother, Romulus took the title as
        the first king of Rome, thereby starting the Roman Period of Kings. This
        period had only six kings after Romulus, under which Rome saw many militaristic and economic
        advances. It was in this period that the Roman constitution was formed,
        paving the way for the Republican period of Rome.</p>

        <div class="page-header align-left">
          <h1>Republican Rome (510-31 BC)</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Rome is no longer under the rule of a king, and developed a new form of
        government: a Republic. Government matters were now settled by the upper
        class, primarily senators. Yet the Romans would elect a dictator in times
        of crisis. Rome took control of the entire Italian peninsula in this period
        and became the dominant Mediterranean power. Civil war followed soon after,
        leaving Rome in a state of unrest that led to the rise of dictator Julius Caesar.
        Under Caesar Rome became increasingly imperialistic, extending its borders
        beyond the Mediterranean. Caesar's assassination in 44 BC led to the rise
        of Octavian as the first emperor of Rome.</p>
        <div class="page-header align-left">
          <h1>Imperial Rome (31 BC - AD 476)</h1>
        </div>
        <p>This final period of Rome lasted from the rise of its first emperor to
        Rome's fall. Rome was in a good stage of its life during this time.
        The empire had reached its maximum size, spanning across three continents
        including Asia Minor, Northern Africa, and most of Europe. The empire had
        grown so large that in AD 286 it split itself into two united empires, each
        with its own emperor. Unfortunately, the western empire fell in AD 455 upon
        suffering Gothic invasions. This is largely considered the end of the overall
        Roman empire, however the eastern Roman empire (aka the Byzantine Empire)
        survived until the 15th century, when Turks took control of the capital city, Constantinople
        (modern-day Istanbul).</p>

            <p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).</p>

It was rebuilt by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated c. 126 AD. Its date of construction is uncertain, because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa's older temple, which had burned down.</p>

            <p>Vatican City, officially the Vatican City State (Italian: Stato della Città del Vaticano; Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae), is an independent city-state and enclave surrounded by Rome, Italy. The Vatican City State, also known simply as the Vatican, became independent from Italy with the Lateran Treaty (1929), and it is a distinct territory under "full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction" of the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity of international law, which maintains the city state's temporal, diplomatic, and spiritual independence. With an area of 49 hectares (121 acres) and a population of about 453, it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population. As governed by the Holy See, the Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state (a type of theocracy) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins. After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere.</p>

It was initially planned by Pope Nicholas V and then Pope Julius II to replace the aging Old St. Peter's Basilica, which was built in the fourth century by Roman emperor Constantine the Great.

            <p>The Roman Forum, also known by its Latin name Forum Romanum (Italian: Foro Romano), is a rectangular forum (plaza) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome. Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum.</p>
